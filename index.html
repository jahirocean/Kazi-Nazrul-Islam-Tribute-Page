                <p><strong>Kazi Nazrul Islam</strong> (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম) (24 May 1899 – 29 August 1976) was a
                    Bengali poet, writer,
                    musician, and revolutionary. He is the national poet of Bangladesh. Popularly known as Nazrul, he
                    produced a large body of poetry and music with themes that included religious devotion and spiritual
                    rebellion against fascism and oppression.</p><br>

                <p>Nazrul's activism for political and social justice earned him the title of "Rebel Poet" (Bengali:
                    বিদ্রোহী কবি; Bidrohi Kobi). His compositions form the avant-garde genre of Nazrul Sangeet (Music of
                    Nazrul). The same genre is known as Nazrul Geeti (Music of Nazrul) in India. In addition to being
                    revered in Bangladesh, he is equally commemorated and revered in India, especially in the Bengali
                    Speaking states of West Bengal and Tripura.</p><br>

                <p> Kazi Nazrul Islam was born on Friday 24 May 1899 at 10:20 am in the village of Churulia in the
                    Asansol
                    Sadar subdivision, Paschim Bardhaman district of the Bengal Presidency (now in West Bengal, India).
                    He
                    was born into a Muslim Taluqdar family and was the second of three sons and a daughter. Nazrul's
                    father
                    Kazi Faqeer Ahmed was the imam and caretaker of the local mosque and mausoleum. Nazrul's mother was
                    Zahida Khatun.</p><br>

                <p>Nazrul had two brothers, Kazi Saahibjaan and Kazi Ali Hussain, and a sister, Umme Kulsum. He was
                    nicknamed Dukhu Miañ (দুখু মিঞা literally, "the one with grief", or "Mr. Sad Man"). Nazrul studied
                    at a
                    maktab and madrasa run by a mosque and a dargah, respectively, where he studied the Quran, Hadith,
                    Islamic philosophy, and theology.</p><br>

                <p> His family was devastated by the death of his father in 1908. At the young age of ten, Nazrul took
                    his
                    father's place as a caretaker of the mosque to support his family, as well as assisting teachers in
                    school. He later had to work as the muezzin at the mosque.</p>
